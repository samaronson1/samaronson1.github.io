<h1 style="text-align:center;">Sports and Fun</h1>
 
<p style="font-size:200%; font-family:'Courier New'; color:Lime; text-align:left;"> I love to play tennis with my friends and teamates. I started playing tennis in 7th grade and have never stopped. I play both private and public tennis, and as a lefty i have a huge advantage over some players!<br>
I also like to play basketball and baseball with my friends, furthermore me and my friends built our own volleyball court! We played on it all summer and hosted tournments and pratices. <br>Even though i'm short I even leanred how to spike a volleyball!
<br>Finally when i'm not playing sports i like to play videogames with my friends! I play alot of Rocket Leauge and Apex Legends.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Academics</h2>
<p style="font-size:200%; font-family:'Courier New'; color:Lime; text-align:left;"> Personally I am totally a math guy. I have taken 2 year advanced math since the 7th grade and am currently taking AP calculus.<br> I am proud to have a 4.0 gpa and work very hard to maintain my grades.<br> I hate english and social studies because I am not good at memorising I am a learner and so it is hard for me to excel in these areas.
<br>I am not a good studier but when I really put my mind to somthing I usually succeed. I studided really hard for my SAT and got a 1490!</p>
